Logout has not yet implemented, because maybe its not required,
JWT token has its own lifetime, if it exceeds its lifetime it
wont be authorized, to implement logout in your front end remove
the session key that contains the token. But, if it IS INDEED 
required, I'll make a list so only token that is in the list is
authorized, logout means that the token is removed fom the list.
